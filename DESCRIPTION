Description: Fit penalized multivariable linear mixed models with a single 
    random effect to control for population structure in genetic association 
    studies. This is a flexible framework which allows for both lasso and group 
    lasso penalties. A lowrank estimation procedure is implemented when the 
    matrix of SNPs used to estimate the kinship matrix is not full rank. 
    Can also handle prior annotation information, for example, rare variants, 
    in the form of weights.
